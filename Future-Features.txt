🚀 Features to Enhance Functionality

🌍 Current Location Weather

Add a button like "Use My Location" that fetches the user's current weather using their geolocation.

Example:

navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(successCallback, errorCallback);

📅 5-Day Forecast

Display upcoming weather predictions using the OpenWeatherMap's 5-day forecast API.

This adds more value to your app instead of just showing the current weather.

🕒 Time and Date Display

Show the current date and time along with weather data.

Fetch the sunrise and sunset times from the API and display them dynamically.

🎨 Dynamic Backgrounds Based on Weather

Change the background based on the weather condition (e.g., rainy, sunny, cloudy).

Use images, gradients, or CSS animations.

📷 Weather Icons & Animations

Use animated icons (like Lottie animations) for a more modern feel.

🎨 UI & Styling Improvements

📱 Make It Fully Responsive

Use react-bootstrap (which you already like) or CSS Grid/Flexbox to make sure it looks great on all screen sizes.

💡 Light/Dark Mode Toggle

Add a toggle button to switch between Light and Dark Mode for better UX.

📊 Interactive Charts

Use Chart.js or Recharts to visualize temperature trends (e.g., hourly temperature changes in a graph).

💬 Voice Search (Optional but Cool)

Let users search weather by voice using the Web Speech API.
